GIS Preparation | Curated Videos to help you study for a GIS certification exam

## About this project

On March 2023 I decided to take ESRI's ArcGIS Pro 2101 certification exam (EAPA2101). I got frustrated to find out that there where not many ressources online to study. I ended up drowning in random YouTube videos from people all around the world.

Once I passed the exam (on the second try), I promised myself to publish a free website where people could find an organized and curated list of YouTube videos that helped me pass the certification exam.

Two weeks later here it is, a curated list of publicly available videos that people can watch for free, so they can be prepared for their GIS certification exams.

This is a free-to-use project. Consider supporting me on the following link so I can keep on adding more content to available GIS certification exams:

If you found a mistake or you think an important video is missing you can:
- Add an issue here on the Github repo or
- Send me an email at andresmorenovasquez@outlook.com

You can also contribute to the code base by opening a pull request.

Let me know about new features you would like to see in the website!

And... Good luck with your exam ðŸ“š

## Project Roadmap

- Add nested routes for "/video" page so that users can watch each video without leaving the page. Imagine a sort of dashboard with video list and video player component.
- Implement persistent Layouts with Remix to improve UX. Currently using Nextjs.
